# Prediction-of-flight-delay
Started by exploring the dataset, with the aim of understanding properties of the delays registered by flights like how the origin airport, geographical location and landing, take-off impacted flight delays. This exploration gave me the occasion of using various visualization tools offered by RStudio. Later split the data into training and testing to build polynomial regression and show the importance of other regularization techniques to predict flight delays by measuring precision, accuracy, sensitivity, recall and F-measure. These results were applied to increase customer satisfaction and income of airline agencies.
